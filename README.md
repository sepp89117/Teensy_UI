# Teensy_UI
User interface for Teensy 4.0 with touchscreen

This library is intended for use with an ILIxxxx_t3n library.
Here it was designed for use with ILI9486_t3n, to be found in my repositories. To change this, all ```ILI9486_t3n``` in ```BUI.h``` must be replaced. If someone knows a better way, I look forward to an explanation!

How the Lib is used can be seen in the example. It's an easy way to add elements to the screen and work with touch events.
